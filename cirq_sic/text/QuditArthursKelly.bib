    abstract = {In a previous paper we have presented a general scheme for the implementation of symmetric generalized measurements (POVMs) on a quantum computer. This scheme is based on representation theory of groups and methods to decompose matrices that intertwine two representations. We extend this scheme in such a way that the measurement is minimally disturbing, i.e., it changes the state vector ∣Ψ⟩ of the system to Π∣Ψ⟩ where Π is the positive operator corresponding to the measured result. Using this method, we construct quantum circuits for measurements with Heisenberg–Weyl symmetry. A continuous generalization leads to a scheme for optimal simultaneous measurements of position and momentum of a Schrödinger particle moving in one dimension such that the outcomes satisfy ΔxΔp⩾ℏ. The particle to be measured collides with two probe particles, one for the position and the other for the momentum measurement. The position and momentum resolution can be tuned by the entangled joint state of the probe particles which is also generated by a collision with hard-core potential. The parameters of the POVM can then be controlled by the initial widths of the wave functions of the probe particles. We point out some formal similarities and differences to simultaneous measurements of quadrature amplitudes in quantum optics.},

    abstract = {We consider group-covariant positive operator valued measures (POVMs) on a finite dimensional quantum system. Following Neumark’s theorem a POVM can be implemented by an orthogonal measurement on a larger system. Accordingly, our goal is to find a quantum circuit implementation of a given group-covariant POVM which uses the symmetry of the POVM. Based on representation theory of the symmetry group we develop a general approach for the implementation of group-covariant POVMs which consist of rank-one operators. The construction relies on a method to decompose matrices that intertwine two representations of a finite group. We give several examples for which the resulting quantum circuits are efficient. In particular, we obtain efficient quantum circuits for a class of POVMs generated by Weyl–Heisenberg groups. These circuits allow to implement an approximative simultaneous measurement of the position and crystal momentum of a particle moving on a cyclic chain.},
